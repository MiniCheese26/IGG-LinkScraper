# IGG-LinkScraper

As the title implies, this small tool will grab the links of a chosen host from IGG-Games.
* Just paste a link in
* Choose the host
* And either display the links or export them

## Todo
* Add other hosts IGG-Games used.

This is my first real tool I've ever programmed in C# so it may be inefficient or hacky at places but it's a learning process isn't it?

# Enjoy
